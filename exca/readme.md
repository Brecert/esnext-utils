# EXCA
> Extended EMCAScript

Basically just stage-0+ babel plugins and a custom resolver for modules right now.

## Usage (from this folder)
> `npm run exca run help`

## Todo:
- checking and resolving import maps for every import (where possible)
- operator overloading
- babel macros
- wasm importing and maybe some default compiled language that can be imported
